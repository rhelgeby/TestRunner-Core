Test Runner - Usage
===================


Installation
------------

Requirements:

    * HTML5 compatible browser with JavaScript enabled.
    * HTML5 Web Storage (used to store test progress between pages)

Test Runner is installed by including its source in every page in the
application (at minimum in every page that tests use). In addition the test
case code must be included (test_main.js).

Note: All test code must be loaded in all pages where tests are executed. If
      some tests are excluded in some pages, the test progress state will be
      corrupt.

Example:

    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="test_iterator.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="assert.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="test_runner.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="test_main.js"></script>


Creating Tests
--------------

Tests are defined in a object hierarchy with TestCase, TestCollection and
TestSuite objects.


COLLECTIONS
Test cases are stored in collections, so at least one test collection must be
created first:

    var mainCollection = new TestCollection("Main collection");
    var secondCollection = new TestCollection("Second collection");


TEST CASES
Once a collection is created, test cases can be added to it.

A test case is divided into phases. Each phase is a function, and if a test
need to change the page, a second phase (function) is required to resume
testing on the new page. Most test cases only need one phase.

Since a test case is usually only added to one collection, it's easy to add it
inline. Note that the last parameter of the TestCase constructor is an array:

    mainCollection.addTest(new TestCase("demo", "index.html",
    [
        function()
        {
            // Test code here.
            
            var myButton = document.getElementById("myButton");
            var status = document.getElementById("status");
            assertInstanceOf(myButton, Button);
            assertNotNull(status);
            
            myButton.click();
            
            assertHTMLEquals(status, "Button clicked.");
        }
    ]));

With two phases:

    mainCollection.addTest(new TestCase("two phases", "page1.html",
    [
        function()
        {
            // First phase (do stuff...)
            
            // Change page.
            window.location.href = "page2.html";
            
            // Abort test runner so page can be changed. If not aborted here
            // it will immediately continue at the next phase.
            return false;
        },
        function()
        {
            // Second phase.
            
            // Continue testing in page2.html...
        }
    ]));


TEST SUITE
The test runner expects a test suite of collections with test cases. There may
be created several test suites with various combinations of collections, but
only one test suite can be passed to the test runner.

    var testSuite = new TestSuite("All tests", [mainCollection, secondCollection]);

It also accepts two function references for functions to be executed before and
after every test:

    function beforeTest()
    {
        console.log("Before test...");
    }
    
    function afterTest()
    {
        console.log("After test...");
    }
    
    var demoSuite = new TestSuite("Before/after demo", [mainCollection], beforeTest, afterTest);


Running Tests
-------------

Construct a new TestRunner object with the test suite object as the first
parameter, and a URL string to the result page as the second parameter.

In combination with PhoneGap, it's suitable to initialize tests and test runner
in the body onload event of each page.

Once initialized, a call to runIfActive should make it start or resume
automatically on every page where it's enabled.

Note: PhoneGap may need some time to complete initialization. If the
deviceReady event in PhoneGap isn't fired, a timer may be used as a fallback.
How long to wait depends on the hardware. Keep the delay as low as possible
(~100 ms) because it's added between each page load.

    var testRunner = new TestRunner(testSuite, "test_results.html");
    testRunner.runIfActive();

In the result page it build results instead of running tests:

    var testRunner = new TestRunner(testSuite, "test_results.html");
    testRunner.buildResults();



Test Runner - Technical Description
===================================

Goals
-----

* Automatic. No user interaction should be required (except for starting the
  application and reviewing test results).

* Based on web technologies (HTML5, JavaScript). Makes it platform independent.
  Lives in the web browser.

* Suitable for function tests in web GUIs as well as regular unit tests.

* Embedded in application, with minimal impact on application code.

* Compatible with PhoneGap. Designed for use with PhoneGap, but does not depend
  on it.



How Test Runner Works
---------------------

Test Runner is a tool for running automatic unit and function testing in web
applications. It's written in JavaScript and embedded with the application.

PHASES
In contrast to regular test cases in other tools, Test Runner support multiple
phases per test. Test phases are required when tests need to change the page,
such as writing text in form fields, submitting and then verifying the result
in another page. If any phase fail to complete, the test will fail.

Each phase is a function reference located in an array in the test case object.
Test Runner will iterate and execute these functions in the order they are
referenced.

Test runner can be aborted by returning false in any phase. Test progress will
be saved so it can be resumed on a new page.


SAVING STATE
To keep each test isolated, the page is reloaded or changed between tests.
Before loading a new page the test progress must be saved. It's serialized
in JSON format and saved in a session variable by using the Web Storage feature
of HTML5.

Every time Test Runner is loaded, the state is restored if a test session is
still active.

Note: Include all tests in every page tests are executed. The test progress is
      based on counters in iterators. If some tests are excluded in other pages
      the counter may point to wrong tests (and possibly create a infinite
      loop), or point to a invalid array index.


INITIALIZING TEST RUNNER
The developer has to build tests and construct a TestRunner object before
starting tests.

A TestSuite object is passed to the TestRunner constructor, along with a URL to
the test result page template.


STARTING TEST RUNNER
When any page is loaded, the test runner should be initialized and started.
PhoneGap applications may need a delayed start (~150+ ms, depending on
hardware) to wait for PhoneGap to initialize first.

Once the test runner is started it will check if there's an active test session
and resume its state, or start a new one. Then it will loop through and
execute all tests in the test suite.

When all tests are executed it will load the result page. All test results are
saved along with the test runner state. The result page initializes a test
test runner in result mode. It results in a call to buildResults which makes
test runner output formatted test results in a HTML-element named "results".



Test Runner Objects
-------------------

ITERATOR
The iterator object is used to iterate through collections and test cases.
Its state is serializable so the test progress can be saved and restored.


TEST CASE
The TestCase object stores the array with test phase functions, a name and the
URL of the page to load where the test is executed.


TEST COLLECTION
Stores a name and an array of TestCase objects. Collections are used to group
related tests so it's possible to test a certain part of the application only.


TEST SUITE
A test suite is a collection of test collections. Test Runner iterate through
collections and execute all tests. Several test suites may be created to
execute only a certain set of collections.

In addition it accepts function references for functions to be executed before
and after each test.


TEST RUNNER
The main object. Manages state and execute tests.

The only "public" methods are run, runIfActive and buildResults. All others are
considered private and should not be called directly.
